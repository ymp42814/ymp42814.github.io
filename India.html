Introduction
</h3>
<section>
<p>
<big>India is a country that gained independence in August 14, 1947. It is a country with a long history houses the rich culture of many different people. This is country I was born in and fundamentally the starting point of my life. Having moved here at the tender age of two, my parents wanted to keep the sense of culture in me alive. Therefore we frequently went back to India and are planning to go again this December. The trip never disappoints as it allows me to spend time with my family and partake in a variety of activities from enjoying the delicacies provided by street vendors, to travelling around the bustling city of Mumbai. This trip is also always a wakeup call as to the privilege that I not only have, but people in the United States have in general. The displays of extreme poverty and homelessness are always sights that never fail to make me appreciate the little things in life.</big>
