Introduction

<big>Canada is our neighbor to the North and is often times reduced to being known for Niagara Falls, Toronto, or hockey. Yet, many people have not experienced the beauty that can be found on the western coast of Canada and all that it has to offer. My family ventured on a trip to Western Canada one summer and I found it to be one of the most extraordinary displays of nature that I have ever seen. From the clarity of the lakes to the beautiful hiking trails and snowy mountain tops, this area showed the ability of Mother Nature when not excessively bothered by human contact and industrialization. This trip gave me a greater sense of appreciation for the environment, and provided my family with a pure bonding experience that brought us closer as a unit. Namely, Banff is the city that really gave me the sense of purity in nature due to not only the natural displays, but how people in the city interacted with it in a respectful and safe manner. </big>
