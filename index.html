<p>
<big>Hello! My name is <b>Yash Patel.</b> <br>I am a freshman at the University of Georgia and intend to major in finance. I am from a small coastal town known as Hinesville, Georgia, a rural area where I have spent the majority of my life. However, the experiences from that town do not necessarily hold my most memorable ones. In fact, my trips to India and Canada have provided me with a broad set of different experiences that I will not forget. Without these trips, I may not have be the person I am today as I learned important values that have stuck with me today. Also, the chance to spend time with my family and create unforgettable memories is something I will not ever forget. I would like to give you some insight into these trips and provide some knowledge about the countries I visited.<u> Click on the links in the table above to learn about each trip!</u></big>
